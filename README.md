- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ryan-T-Shaffer.
  Iâ€™m pursuing a career in data and am focused on becoming a data analyst skilled in SQL and dashboarding tools. I hope to apply my experience in machine learning, data science, signal processing, and software engineering throughout my career. My current repositoryâ€”Medicare DE-SynPUF Analysis (MLR, PMPM Cost, PMPM Count, 2008â€“2010)â€”is available here: [medicare-desynpuf-mlr-pmpm-2008-2010](https://github.com/Ryan-T-Shaffer/medicare-desynpuf-mlr-pmpm-2008-2010).
