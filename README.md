- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ryan-T-Shaffer.
  Iâ€™m interested in a career in data. Iâ€™m currently working to become a data analyst skilled in SQL and dashboarding software. One day I hope to apply my experience in machine learning, data science, signal processing, and software engineering to my career. This repository, linked on my GitHub profile, showcases a data analytics project I recently completed in the healthcare industry.
