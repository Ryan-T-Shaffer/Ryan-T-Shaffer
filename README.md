- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ryan-T-Shaffer
  Iâ€™m interested in a career in Data. I am currently working to become a Data Analyst who is skilled in SQL and Dashboarding Software. I one day hope to apply my experience in Machine Learning, Data Science, Signal Processing, and Software Enginnering to my career in the future. This repository I have attached to my guthub profile showcases Data Analyst project I have recently completed about the healthcare industry.
