- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ryan-T-Shaffer
  Iâ€™m interested in a career in Machine Learning and Data Science. Iâ€™m learning about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Data Science, and Signal Processing.
  I am currently in the final semester of my undergraduate degree at UD. I am in the honors college majoring in biomedical engineering and minoring in computer science.
  This repository below showcases different projects I have worked on in my own time that relate to ML, DL, data science, and signal processing.
